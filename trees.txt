binary tree ->  node with at most 2 childs

struct Node{
    int data,
    Node* left,
    Node* right
}


Strict/proper binary tree -> node with 0 or 2 childs

complete BT -> all levels expect last are completely filles and all node as as left as possible
    max no of nodes at lvel i -> 2 power i

Perfect bT
    ->  max no of nodes in a bt wiht height h = 2 power h+1  -1
    -> height of perfect bt with n nodes log2 n+1 -1
